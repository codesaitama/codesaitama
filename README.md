### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Believe it or not I code almost everyday. Made it a priority to enhance my coding chakra to the sage of six paths' level. I have been building all types of applications using different technologies for fun.
I also have weekly leetcode and hackerrank challenges repo [CodeChallenges](https://github.com/codesaitama/CodeChallenge).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also mastering react-native then I'll move on to flutter.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love anime and music of all genre.
